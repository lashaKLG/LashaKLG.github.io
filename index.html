                    <span class="hello">HELLO</span> my future employer, my name is Lasha, I am 36 years old, I am from Ukraine from the city of Odessa.
                     In Ukraine I was engaged in the construction of solar power plants as a project manager.
                     <br>
                      Before that I worked as a sales manager in companies that deal with electrical goods, and many other things.
                       Now there is a war in my country, and it made me reconsider the life values that surrounded me.
                       I began to think about what brought me pleasure and realized that this is my hobby, namely the world of computer games.
                       I had my own channel on <span class="twitch">TWITCH</span> where I streamed the gameplay of my games, and my secret desire has always been to develop in the gaming world and maybe even release a game by collecting experience from my gaming life. I became interested in programming and since coming to the Netherlands I have finished 3-month <span class="matrix">Matrix Master courses</span> . I want to find a team of like-minded people who can help me fully become part of the IT Planet.
                       My ultimate goal is to work in the gaming industry, but I can start my way as a Front-end developer. During the Matrix Master courses I took a <span class="full">Full Stack Developer</span> course and there I mastered the basics of using:

                    <br>
                    ·  HTML5, CSS3, AJAX
                    <br>
                    ·  React, jQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize
                    <br>
                    ·  NodeJS, MongoDB, Express Js
                    <br>
                    ·  WordPress
                    <br>

                     . Node.js
                     <br>
                       At the moment I am engaged in self-development and take courses in Python and also try to make up websites in order to have a portfolio.
                        I am ready and really want to learn. I really want to work in the gaming industry or everything related to it.
                         Naturally I am also open to any offer in the field of fitness technologies.
                        I'm really looking forward to our meeting! I hope you liked my short description. 
                        I am a very joyful and sociable person.
